                This is an experiment on group decision-making. In this experiment you will make a series of
                choices. At the end of
                the experiment, you will be paid depending on the specific choices that you made during the
                experiment and the
                choices made by other participants.

                This experiment has 4 modules, and you will be able to earn money in each module. Your total
                earnings will be the
                sum of your payoffs in each module plus the show-up fee (CHECK: IS THERE A SHOW-UP FEE?). Each
                module will start
                with a brief instruction period, after which we complete that module.

                If you have questions during the instruction period, please raise your hand after I have
                completed reading the
                instructions. Your questions will be answered out loud so everyone can hear. Please restrict
                these questions to
                clarifications about the instructions only. If you have any questions after the paid session of
                the experiment has
                begun, raise your hand, and I will come and assist you. Apart from the questions directed to the
                experimenter, you
                are expressly asked to refrain from communicating with other participants in the experiment.
