    This is an experiment on group decision-making. In this experiment you will make a series of choices. At the end of
    the experiment, you will be paid depending on the specific choices that you made during the experiment and the
    choices made by other participants.

    This experiment has 4 modules, and you will be able to earn money in each module. Your total earnings will be the
    sum of your payoffs in each module plus the show-up fee (CHECK: IS THERE A SHOW-UP FEE?). Each module will start
    with a brief instruction period, after which we complete that module.

    If you have questions during the instruction period, please raise your hand after I have completed reading the
    instructions. Your questions will be answered out loud so everyone can hear. Please restrict these questions to
    clarifications about the instructions only. If you have any questions after the paid session of the experiment has
    begun, raise your hand, and I will come and assist you. Apart from the questions directed to the experimenter, you
    are expressly asked to refrain from communicating with other participants in the experiment.
