    Introduction to Module 1

{% endblock %}

{% block inner_content %}
    Module 1 will consist of 10 different rounds. At the beginning of the first round, you will be randomly assigned a
    role of either Player 1 or Player 2. You will keep that role for the remainder of this module.

    In each round, all participants will be randomly matched into pairs, each consisting of one Player 1 and one Player
    2. In each new round, the participants will be re-matched into pairs, always matched with a new/different
    participant. The composition of matched pairs will, thus, always be different in different rounds of the module. All
    of participants' interactions will take place anonymously through a computer terminal, so your true personal
    identity will never be revealed to others, and you will not know who precisely is in your pair in any round of the
    experiment.

    In each round of the experiment, the subject in the role of Player 1 makes choices that affect the outcomes with
    respect to two Tasks. For each of these Tasks, Player 1’s choices are to pay a cost for increasing the probability
    that the outcome on that Task is Success or to forego that cost, with the consequence of the outcome on that Task is
    certain to be Failure.

    If Player 1 chooses to pay the cost, the chance of Success on that Task is 5 out of 10, that is, there is a .5
    probability of the outcome on that Task being Success. If Player 1 chooses not to pay that cost, then the outcome on
    that Task is Failure.

    Player 2 will be paid depending on the outcome of the Tasks. Player 1 will be paid depending on Player 2’s decision
    whether to retain or fire (IS AWARD THE BONUS BETTER? SINCE THEY ARE NOT MAKING ANOTHER CHOICE FOR THE SAME
    PRINCIPAL, FIRE/RETAIN IS AWKWARD) Player 1.

    Your earnings from the session/module will be determined by a random selection of one (OR MORE? HOW MANY – DEPENDS
    ON THE EXCHANGE RATE…) of the rounds for compensation.
