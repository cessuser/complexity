            <div class="mb-2 ">
                You are {{player.get_role_name}} in this game and have been randomly matched with Player 1.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">
                Player 1 has an initial endowment of 300 ECUs. That player can use this endowment to pay a cost to
                increase the
                probability of Success on ONE, BOTH, OR NEITHER OF 2 Tasks Task 1 and Task 2. The cost to Player 1 of
                increasing the
                probability of Success on either Task is 150 ECUs. Thus, if Player 1 chooses to pay the cost on one of
                the two
                Tasks, s/he will be deducted 150 ECUs from that round’s payoff. If s/he chooses to pay the cost on both
                Tasks, s/he
                will be deducted 300 ECUs from that round’s payoff. If s/he chooses not to pay the cost on either Task,
                s/he will
                keep your 300 ECUs.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">

                If Player 1 chooses to pay the cost on a given Task, the chance of Success on that Task is 5 out of 10,
                that is,
                there is a .5 probability of the outcome on that Task being Success. If Player 1 chooses not to pay that
                cost, then
                the outcome on that Task is Failure.

            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">


                Depending on the outcomes on the two Tasks, you can earn money.

                In each round, before observing the outcomes on the Tasks, you will first choose a rule that determines
                when Player
                1 is retained or fired contingent on the outcomes on the Tasks. Your choices will be:
            </div>

            <div class="mb-2 ">

                <ul>
                    {% for i in Constants.RETAININGCHOICES %}
                        <li>{{ i.1 }}</li>
                    {% endfor %}

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">

                If according to the retention rule you announced, Player 1 is retained, Player 1 will earn an additional
                900 ECUs.
                If according to the retention rule you announced Player 1 is fired, then Player 1 will not earn any
                additional
                money.

                You will then make a second choice: a guess of what choices Player 1 is going to make.

            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">

                The payoff you will receive for the round will depend on two things: the outcomes on each task, and your
                guesses of
                Player 1’s choices. For each Task outcome of Success, you will gain 280 ECUs. And for each correct guess
                of Player
                1’s choice, you will gain 140 ECUs.

            </div>

            <div class="mb-2 ">
                To illustrate: suppose, as in the example above, that Player 2 chose “Always Retain.” Suppose, further,
                that Player
                2 guessed that Player 1 would choose to pay the cost on both Tasks, which turned out to be correct.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">
                If the outcomes on both Tasks turn out to be Success, then s/he will receive
                280 ECUs (Task 1) + 280 ECUs (Task 2) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 1) +140 ECU (guess on Task 2) = 840 ECUs.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">
                If the outcome on Task 1 is Success but the outcome on Task 2 is Failure, then Player 2 receives 280
                ECUs (Task 1) +
                0 ECUs (Task 2) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 1) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 2) = 560 ECUs.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">
                If the outcome on Task 1 is Failure but the outcome on Task 2 is Success, then Player 2 receives 0
                ECUs (Task 1) +
                280 ECUs (Task 2) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 1) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 2) = 560 ECUs.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-2 ">

                If the outcome on both Tasks is Failure, then Player 2 receives
                0 ECUs (Task 1) + 0 ECUs (Task 2) + 140 ECU (guess on Task 1) +140 ECU (guess on Task 2) = 280 ECUs.
